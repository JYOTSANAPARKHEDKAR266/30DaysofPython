# 30DaysofPython

📘 30DaysOfPython

Hi! 👋

I’ve started a 30-day Python coding challenge to improve my Python skills, build consistency, and explore new concepts every day.

Over the next 30 days, I’ll be coding daily and documenting my progress here — from basics to more advanced topics. Each day’s work will be saved in its respective folder with scripts, notes, and exercises.

🌟 Why this challenge?
To strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals 🐍

To practice problem solving and clean coding 🧹

To build a habit of coding every single day 💻

To have fun learning and creating along the way 🎯

📅 Progress
✅ Day 1: Introduction
✅ Day 2: Variables and built-in functions
⬜ Day 3: …
⬜ … up to Day 30

(I’ll update this as I go!)

🤝 Join Me?

If you’re also learning Python, feel free to follow along, try the exercises, and connect — we can learn together!
